# R 2EMA Color Indicator

This code is a custom indicator for the MetaTrader 4 platform. It calculates two Exponential Moving Averages (EMAs) with different periods and detects crossover points. When the shorter EMA crosses above the longer EMA, a buy signal is generated. Conversely, when the shorter EMA crosses below the longer EMA, a sell signal is generated.

## Indicator Parameters

- EMA_Period1: Period for the first EMA (default value: 10)
- EMA_Period2: Period for the second EMA (default value: 20)

## Indicator Output

The indicator displays two lines on the chart representing the calculated EMAs. The first EMA is labeled 'EMA1' and the second EMA is labeled 'EMA2'. The lines are drawn using the DRAW_LINE style.

## Signal Generation

The indicator generates trade signals based on the detected crossover points of the EMAs. When a buy signal is detected (current close price is above both EMAs and previous close price is below both EMAs), the code prints a message indicating a buy trade signal should be generated. Similarly, when a sell signal is detected (current close price is below both EMAs and previous close price is above both EMAs), the code prints a message indicating a sell trade signal should be generated.

Please note that the actual trade signal generation code is not provided in this code snippet and should be replaced with the appropriate logic for your trading strategy.
